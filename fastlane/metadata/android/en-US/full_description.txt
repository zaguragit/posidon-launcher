This is not your typical pixel launcher. posidon launcher was built from scratch, to be a different experience.

Minimal: There are constant improvements and optimizations in the ux, to make all of the settings as easy to understand as possible.

Feature-rich:
- Dock supports up to 7 columns and 3 rows of icons
- News & Notifications feed
- Vector and animated iconpack support
- App search
- Wallpaper gallery (all wallpapers are exclusive)
- 6 Font options
- Blur behind app drawer
- A lot more

Different: This launcher doesn't have pages, it has a scrollable feed. It's UI was inspired by One UI & elementary OS.

posidon launcher is a nonprofit project, so I wont always be able to fix everything by myself, if you want to help posidon launcher become better, please report any bugs at t.me/posidonlauncher.
